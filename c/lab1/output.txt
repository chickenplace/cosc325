--- Part 1: State and Sequence ---
x=20

--- Part 2: Control Flow ---
sum_to(5) = 0 (expected 15)
sum_to(1) = 0 (expected 1)

--- Part 3: Functions as Procedures ---
avg_1_to_n(5) = 0.0 (expected 3.0)

--- Part 4: Pass-by-Value vs Pointers ---
after increment_bad: a=5 (expected 5)
after increment:     a=5 (expected 6)
